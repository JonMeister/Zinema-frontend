00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Water falls in multiple crystalline threads, gently hitting the rocks.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
The constant murmur fills the forest with a pure and enveloping sound.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
Sunlight filters through the leaves, illuminating the dew suspended in the air.

The green moss shines beneath the moisture, breathing along with the water.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
Droplets spread like small lights over the surface of the pond.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
Everything vibrates with life: the water, the forest, and the silence between them.
