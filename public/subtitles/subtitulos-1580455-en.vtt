00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
A lonely road makes its way through the autumn trees.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Fallen leaves cover the asphalt like a golden tapestry.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
The wind blows gently, moving the branches illuminated by the sun.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Silence, light, and color blend in a moment of calm.
