00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Two bodies touch with the naturalness of trust and silence.

00:10.000 --> 00:20.000
A hand slowly travels over the skin, feeling the texture and warmth of the other.

00:20.000 --> 00:30.000
Light highlights the tones, shapes, and contrast between soft shadows.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
There are no words, only shared breathing and stillness.

00:40.000 --> 00:52.000
Movement is slight, almost imperceptible, as if time itself paused.

00:52.000 --> 01:04.000
Two distinct presences merge into a single gesture of calm.
