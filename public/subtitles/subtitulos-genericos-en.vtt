00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
At dawn, the city awakened with a soft murmur and the sun's gleam on the windows.

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Through the empty streets, a silhouette walked unhurried, observing how the world began anew.

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
The wind dragged dry leaves, as if they too were seeking their destiny.

00:21.000 --> 00:30.000
Each step echoed on the sidewalk, marking the rhythm of a story that was just beginning.

00:30.000 --> 00:39.000
Suddenly, laughter broke the silence. A simple, human, warm laughter.

00:39.000 --> 00:47.000
The sound of the sea—or perhaps the traffic—merged with their breathing.

00:47.000 --> 00:55.000
For an instant, everything seemed to stop: the air, the light, the thoughts.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
And they understood that, sometimes, the smallest thing can also be the beginning of something immense.
