00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
The wind stirs the stalks, bending them under the golden sunlight.

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Behind, the water reflects warm sparkles that slowly fade.

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
Each stem moves with its own rhythm, as if breathing with the afternoon.

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
The air is light, and the horizon is tinged with soft and golden tones.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
The sun descends little by little, covering the field with luminous calm.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
The breeze continues, carrying with it the last glow of the day.
