00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
From above, the sea hits the rocks with patient force.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
White foam spreads like feathers over the turquoise water.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
The waves retreat and return, drawing shapes that change endlessly.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
The coast blends between tones of sand, stone, and movement.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
The roar of the ocean becomes a constant pulse, almost hypnotic.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Everything seems to stop, except the eternal rhythm of the sea.
