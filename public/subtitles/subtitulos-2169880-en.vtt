00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
The drone rises showing the tropical coast: turquoise water, gentle waves, and a strip of golden sand.

00:10.000 --> 00:20.000
Between the sound of the sea and wind, the shore blends with dense vegetation and the red roofs of the village.

00:20.000 --> 00:35.000
Palm trees sway slowly, as if breathing with the rhythm of the waves.

00:35.000 --> 00:50.000
From above, the sea opens in different shades, reflecting the sunlight.

00:50.000 --> 01:05.000
Rocks protrude from the water while small figures walk in the distance.

01:05.000 --> 01:15.000
Everything seems to move slowly: the sea, the air, and time.

01:15.000 --> 01:25.000
The shot pulls away, leaving behind the coast and the quiet murmur of the ocean.
