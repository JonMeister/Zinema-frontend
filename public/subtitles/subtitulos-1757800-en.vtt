00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
The sea breathes strongly. Waves rise and break gently on the shore.

00:08.000 --> 00:16.000
The sky is covered with clouds that move slowly, as if watching the water from above.

00:16.000 --> 00:24.000
Each wave is born, curves, and dissolves into white foam that melts into the sand.

00:24.000 --> 00:32.000
The breeze carries the smell of salt and the promise of a new dawn.

00:32.000 --> 00:40.000
The horizon becomes blurred, as if the sea and sky were one.

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
The waves continue, eternal, marking the rhythm of time.
