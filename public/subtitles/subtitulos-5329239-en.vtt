00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
A couple stands by a red van parked in the middle of the forest.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
The sun shines through the treetops, illuminating the scene with warm tones.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
She leans on the bumper, smiling, while he looks at her attentively.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
They both laugh softly, enjoying the moment in silence.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
The wind gently moves the leaves and the girl's hair.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
He crosses his arms, relaxed, observing the horizon between the trees.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
She comments something and makes a gesture with her hand, animated.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
The two share a knowing glance before turning their gaze back to the path.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
The surroundings feel peaceful; only nature can be heard around.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
The sun shifts position, casting new shadows on the sandy ground.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
She takes a deep breath and smiles, as if keeping a memory.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
He nods slowly, and both remain there, enjoying the calm.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
The camera slowly pulls away, leaving the van among the trees.
